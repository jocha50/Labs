1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements?

		setTimeout(booyah, 2000); // the booyah function will be excuted after 2000ms

		setTimeout(booyah(), 2000); //the booyah function will be excuted right after this line is called.

2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?

	var myfunc = function(a, x) {
	 return a * x;
	};
	var x = myfunc(2, 3);
	var y = myfunc;
	alert(x);   // this will alert the number "6"
	alert(y(2,3)); // this one will alert the number "6" as well, because the var y is now a function which has the reference of the function " myfunc"
	
	
3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that says “BOOYAH!”
		setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
			function booyah1(){
				alert("BOOYAH");
			}

		setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);
		
			function booyah2(){
				setTimeout(tempFunction,2000);
			}
			function tempFunction(){
				alert("BOOYAH");
			}
4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
for using it)?

	-> unobstusive Javascript allows us to separate our website into 3 major parts
		1st -- HTML or the content of our website
		2nd -- CSS or the presentation of our website
		3rd -- Javascript or the behaviour of our website.
	
	-> The practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript is to separate each of these parts in a different files so that 
		it will be easy for debugging and your code will be clean and neat aswell. However, the main reason for using it is 
		i think it's because we can easly modify and/or remove the Javascript parts without affecting our static website.
