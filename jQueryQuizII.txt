1. Which, if any, of the following 3 code fragments are equivalent? Explain why they are different, if
they are. Explain why they can have different parameters and be equivalent, if they are equivalent.
			//code fragment 1
			$("li").each(function(idx, e) {
			 $(e).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
			 
			//code fragment 2
			$("li").each(function() {
			 $(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
			 
			//code fragment 3
			$("li").each(function(idx) {
			 $(this).css(“color”, “yellow”); });
			 
			 
		-> Answer
		I bealive all of the code fragmets will perfom the same.
		
		code fragment 1
			-> the each loop callback function  takes two arguments , one is the index and the other is the specific element
			in that index. so the second statement on the code will excute the color yellow to each element
			that has li tag in it.
			
		code fragment 2
			->the each loop callback function takes no argument, however, the "this" keyword in the second line points to the li element
			at that specific iteration. so both code 1 and code 2 are doing the same thing
			
		code fragment 3
			-> eventhough, the each loop callback function takes one argument, which is index, this is still doing the same thing as code 1 and 2
			
			 
2. Write a jQuery expression to find all divs on a page that include an unordered list in them, and make
their text color be blue.
					 <div>no ul here </div>
					 <div>
					 This does contain a ul.
					 <ul>
					 <li>the first item</li>
					 <li>the second item</li>
					 </ul>
					 </div>
					 <script>
						<!—INSERT YOUR JQUERY CODE HERE - - >
					
						$('div ul').css('color','blue');
					
					 </script>
					 </body>
3. Write jQuery code to append the following div element (and all of its contents) dynamically to the body
element.
					
					<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>
					HTML:
					
					 <!DOCTYPE html>
					 <html>
					 <head>
					 <meta charset="utf-8">
					 <title>JS Bin</title>
					 </head>
					 <body>
						
						
						<script>
							$('body').append(<div><h1>JQuery Core</h1></div>);
						</script>
					 </body>
					 </html>
